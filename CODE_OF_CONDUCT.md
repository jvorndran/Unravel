- Helping others debug parsing, chunking, or retrieval issues
- Reporting bugs with clear reproduction steps
- Proposing features that enhance RAG experimentation

**We don't tolerate:**

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory behavior
- Disrespectful comments about someone's knowledge level or questions
- Spam, off-topic promotions, or commercial solicitation
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Bad faith arguments or deliberate misrepresentation of issues

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any official communication channels.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by emailing the maintainers or opening a private discussion. All reports will be handled with discretion.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take action including:

- Warning the individual

We prioritize protecting contributors over preserving the comfort of those who violate community standards.
